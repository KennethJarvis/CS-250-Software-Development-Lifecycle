  How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?

  I can ask customers who have to use the program before what improvements can be helpful. I can modify the code using the feedback to make it more useful. User stories can help because it creates a simple requirement description. User stories happen when still in development, so minimal adjustment is necessary. So there is less useless code made. 
  
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  There are many approaches to developing programs. Iterative, agile, prototype, incremental, and waterfall all approach development differently. Knowing the customer and your team is beneficial to implementing the best approach. Scrum is a great agile communication tool. As development progresses in a project, scrum communication can help in every stage of planning, integration, and testing.
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  A good team member in software development understands everyone's role. Helping others reach their goal is as important as reaching your own goals. It is not beneficial if a tester reaches their goal if the developer is missing pieces of programming. Offering help so we all finish is the best way to succeed.
